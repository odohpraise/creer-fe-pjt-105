                If you’re not like me, maybe you’ve been wanting to learn how to code in general, or how to use the React framework in particular.<br></br><br></br>

                Whatever your interest in learning React, this is the place for you.<br></br><br></br>

                I’ve been coding for a long, long time, but in today’s world we can never stop learning… and now React is the next thing on my “to learn” list.<br></br><br></br>

                Welcome!<br></br><br></br>

                As I find useful references, ideas, etc., I’ll post them here, and encourage you to do likewise. I’d like to keep our focus on topics relevant to learning React. So, I’ll tend to shy away from articles comparing different frameworks, how to do things in other frameworks, or other topics that aren’t directly relevant to interests of someone whose primary goal is to learn React. I’ll also tend to not approve submissions which are trying to sell a product or service.</p>
